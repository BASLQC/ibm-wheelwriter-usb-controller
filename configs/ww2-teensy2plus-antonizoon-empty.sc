# Wheelwriter 5 Matrix (ISO Enter)
# A sane, yet minimalist layout.
# Source: Sethstorm from Geekhack.
# http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=55676.msg1372033#msg1372033
#
# Layout Notes:
# Layout mostly follows AT(Ctrl between Tab/Left Shift, Caps Lock below Right Shift) aside from ISO Enter/F11/F12.
#
# Top two keys in the 5-key vertical block are PgUp/PgDn respectively.
# Bottom two keys in the 5-key vertical block are F11/F12 respectively.
#
# The middle key in the 5-key vertical block on the right can be used as follows:
# [Modifier]-WASD : Cursor keys (Up/Left/Down/Right)
# [Modifier]-[Number key] : Equivalent numpad key
# [Modifier]-[Backspace] : Del (for those wishing to perform Ctrl-Alt-Del, use Ctrl-Alt-Modifier-Backspace)
# [Modifier]-[PgDn] : Left Win/GUI key
# [Modifier]-[`] : Escape key
#

# Note: This configuration uses the following pinout with a Teensy++, as pictured:

# Strobe pins, 13 pin strip (1 = leftmost pin as pictured above)
# had to set up differently from sethstorm, because I plug it next to the jack
